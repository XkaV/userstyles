userstyles
==========
The styles whose name begins with "XUL" are only for Firefox UI.

Others may be able to use in any modern web browsers.
There are exceptions to it, however.


Remarks
-------------------------
### _export.sh
Run this script to export all user styles stored in Firefox's user profile directory.

It works for **Firefox w/ Stylish on Windows only**.
