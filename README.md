userstyles
==========
The styles whose name begins with "XUL" are only for Firefox UI.
Others may be able to use in any modern web browsers.

Description describes only what appears to be necessary.


About styles for Web page
-------------------------

### Add_file_icons_to_links.user.css
This style works on Firefox only.

- Add file icons to links (e.g. Be ready to open PDF :D)


About styles for Firefox UI
---------------------------

### XUL_Workaround_for_no_gap_between_thumbnail_and_tab_label.user.css
This workaround is prepared for the environment on which [Tree style tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) and [Informational tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/informational-tab/) are installed.

- Add a gap between thumbnail and tab label


About script
------------

### _export.sh
Put `stylish.sqlite` same directory and execute this script.
Then all style files stored in Stylish will be extracted.

This is prepared for backup easily :D

I create this script for Stylish on Firefox.
